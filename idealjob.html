<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>This is a role that I want to work towards over the next few years. I have a great interest in Network infrastructure, and I do enjoy troubleshooting issues inherent with it. I do also enjoy working and studying in the comfort of my home, and that was also what made this opportunity appealing to me. I believe this role will encompass troubleshooting and monitoring of existing Network infrastructure as well as onsite and off premises server management. It will also provide the opportunity to discuss and develop ways to better the current infrastructure. With regards to the Systems Administration side of the role, I believe this will involve a lot of troubleshooting in all areas, which I will enjoy.</p>
  <p>There are a variety of skills and qualifications that I believe will be required to be a suitable candidate for this position. A huge factor is experience and leadership, with Experience, being exposure to similar problems and understanding how to solve them. The reason for leadership is that any Administrator role involves delegation and teamwork, so the candidate must be able to work effectively with a team. In terms of specific skills required, these would include experience and understanding in Server Management, LAN/ WAN configuration, DHCP management, Active Directory, Azure Active Directory (Cloud Based), Network Infrastructure Management (Switches, routers etc.), Virtual Machine and server deployment (VMware) and many more. With regards to qualifications, it may be necessary to have at least a Bachelor in IT or Computer Science, but company certifications are also a standout, these include the Microsoft Certifications (e.g., Azure Fundamentals etc.).</p>
  <p>Graduating from high school in 2021, I still have a long way to go before I can reach this milestone. I would like to continue in my current role as a Support Technician until I at least complete this degree. By then I am hoping to complete a Microsoft Certification of Azure Fundamentals as well as achieve some Aruba Certifications in Networking. I believe that this role will provide me with a lot of exposure to the challenges I will face in the workplace. I now have a solid understanding of the basics of Windows Server and management, but I do still have a long way to go.</p>
