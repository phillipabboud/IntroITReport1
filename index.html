    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My name is Phillip, I am an RMIT student studying a Bachelor of IT online from Sydney. I completed my final year of high school in 2021. I started my first year out of high school studying for a Bachelor of Civil Engineering at UTS in Sydney. I was not particularly enjoying this course, and at the time I was working as an IT Support Technician for a school (in fact continuing this role today). This role helped me develop a significant interest in IT, so I began to do some research into courses that would allow me to work as well as do as much study remotely, as I do quite enjoy it. I then came across this course at RMIT. In terms of nationality, both my parents are Lebanese, but I was born in Sydney. Arabic is not really spoken around the house with my family, sometimes just with my grandparents, but usually just English. A hobby that I have held onto throughout my entire schooling life is playing and recording music on my guitar and drums. I am also a huge cricket fan, keeping an eye on the score for all of Australiaâ€™s test matches.</p>
