<h1>Background Information</h1>
<p>My name is Phillip, I am an RMIT student studying a Bachelor of IT online from Sydney. I completed my final year of high school in 2021. I started my first year out of high school studying for a Bachelor of Civil Engineering at UTS in Sydney. I was not particularly enjoying this course, and at the time I was working as an IT Support Technician for a school (in fact continuing this role today). This role helped me develop a significant interest in IT, so I began to do some research into courses that would allow me to work as well as do as much study remotely, as I do quite enjoy it. I then came across this course at RMIT. In terms of nationality, both my parents are Lebanese, but I was born in Sydney. Arabic is not really spoken around the house with my family, sometimes just with my grandparents, but usually just English. A hobby that I have held onto throughout my entire schooling life is playing and recording music on my guitar and drums. I am also a huge cricket fan, keeping an eye on the score for all of Australia’s test matches. </p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>My interests in IT dwell completely on my current job as a Level 1 IT Support Technician. Graduating from school in 2021, I had my eyes on the Aviation sector, to eventually become a pilot, until I was offered a role as a Level 1 Support Technician. Here I started learning the basics of Imaging and troubleshooting and many more. While doing this, unfortunately I was unable to study a course in Aviation for various reasons, so I went with my next option which was a Bachelor of Civil Engineering. After spending six months in this degree, and working Part Time in IT support I decided that Civil Engineering was not be for me, and I wanted to pursue a career in IT. The main things that I enjoy about IT include the problem solving and troubleshooting that is inherent with it. Although there are various elements of pressure depending on the situation, I still thoroughly enjoy working through these problems and finding outcomes. I worked closely with the Network Administrators in the company, and have found many aspects interesting, such as Server Management, Networking, DHCP etc.</p>
  <p>When I decided that I wanted to pursue IT, I knew that I had to complete some qualifications. I sought to complete a bachelor’s degree before anything else – flexible so that I can continue working in my job as a Support Technician. I then came across the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT online, which I believed was a perfect fit, and now in my second study period, I believe it has been amazing.</p>
  
  <p>I do not expect I will know absolutely everything about IT upon finishing this degree, however, I strongly believe that much of my learning comes from practical experience and exposure to real challenges in the workplace. By completing this degree, I will have a strong understanding of relevant concepts and skills, and a solid work and study ethic, which will benefit me for life. </p>
  <p>My decision to study at RMIT was driven by its flexible, online format. I wanted to study a course that would allow me to continue working, but also something that I would enjoy. I often reflect on my decision due to the criticism I have faced from those close to me, but I feel proud of my accomplishments I have made so far, and I will continue achieving by studying at RMIT. </p>
