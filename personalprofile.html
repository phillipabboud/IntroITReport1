Personality type: ISFP: </p>
<p>Responsive and accommodating. Sensitive and adaptable, you step in to do what needs to be done and are satisfied by your personal sense of being helpful to others. You are quiet and unassuming and may be hard to get to know. However, to those who know you well, you are warm and friendly, eager to share in life’s many experiences. (The TypeFinder Personality Test, 2022).</p>
  <h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
  <p>I believe that there are many takeaways from these three tests regarding the overall results. From test 1, I found the 63% feeling result quite interesting, showing that I initiate decisions based on feelings rather than thought. I believe that this is something that I need to work on over the next few years, and one way this can be done is by exposing myself to uncomfortable situations. I was very much expecting the result from test 2, being a tactile learner. I do find it challenging to sit down for long periods of time and focus on tasks that don’t particularly interest me, this is something that I will require attention to, especially in a group setting. The results from test 3 very much mimic test 1’s results, as expected.</p>
  <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
  <p>The result of going off feelings rather than thought may greatly affect the overall progress and dynamics of a team project. This is vastly since if someone is to make a decision solely off how they feel rather than common sense, it may be completely incorrect and other team members will not be happy at all. I believe being a tactile learner in a team is a good thing, however in an online environment, I will need to work on my auditory and visual skills a lot more to be able to work better in an online team environment.</p>
  <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
  <p>I think it would be a good start to have a discussion with team members prior to commencing the project on how we all learn and what our temperaments are. This will assist us in distributing workloads effectively and ensuring that each member of the team is able to work to their potential. I believe that I will need to improve with regards to talking to new people, and not making judgements of members based on first interactions. I understand that I do struggle to talk to people for the first time, but I believe that this skill will greatly assist my interactions and communication with the team.</p>
