<h1>Project Idea – Phantom Drum Kit</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> Via the use of accelerometers, gyroscopes and haptic feedback actuators integrated into two wands (sticks), a user can virtually hit the positions of a drum kit, which is then either recorded onto an external device such as a laptop or fed directly into external sound devices (either headphones or speakers). The data gathered from the devices can either be processed then transmitted into the external devices or transmit the raw data and have this externally processed a much higher audio quality for the end user. A third device in the form of a necklace will be required to assist the sticks in identifying the end position of the user, as well as monitoring the user's overall movement. For the purpose of this project, the focus will be on the development of the application required to process the data and produce the sound.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Cost is an enormous factor and limitation to many people wanting to learn how to play the drums. Following the succession of this project, I am hopeful that it will provide many people with the opportunity to play the drums at a much more affordable price. The idea behind the project stems from this, but also from my great interest in music and playing the drums. I also believe that this will be a great opportunity for those people that are limited by the amount of space that they have available to practice playing the drums, as well as noise.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Using a custom-made circuit board, a microcontroller can interface with the accelerometer and gyroscope to calculate its virtual position relative to the end user. This can be coupled with a small actuator to give haptic feedback when the virtual position of the drumstick comes into contact or intercepts the imaginary drum kit.</p>
<p>The production for the “sticks” will involve a lot of time and effort. The outer casing of the sticks will be 3D printed with a very light filament. This is so to mimic the weight of real wooden drumsticks. The reason for the sticks being hollow is that we can store and mount the accelerometers and gyroscopes inside of them. After the outer shell has been printed, it is now time to work on the internals, where we will need to fit an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a haptic feedback actuator (this will provide the user with the sensation of playing a real drum kit). So, all that the user will require to do is to sit on a drum stool with the sticks and “play” the imaginary drum kit with his sticks, with either some headphones on or some surround sound.</p>
<p>After the production of the sticks comes the creation of the application that will convert the data from the sticks into sound mimicking a drum kit. Developing the application will involve a significant amount of work and for me, it will be a huge challenge as my understanding of API, UX, and UI development is very low, however I am willing to learn. For the back end, there will be a database server hosting each individual type of sound produced by percussion sound produced by all parts of the drum kit. The database will import these sounds into an application which the user will be able to listen to. The application itself will have the enormous task of converting data received from the sticks into the sound that it receives from the database.</p>
<p>With regards to connecting the devices (the drumsticks) to the application, my intention is to keep it simple and utilise the technology inherent with Bluetooth pairing. The devices will also need to be charged at some stage; this will be done via Micro-USB into the bottom of the sticks.</p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>I will require a 3D printer and some lightweight filament to print the outer casing of the devices. I will then require two accelerometers, one for each device, and two gyroscopes, again one for each device. I will also require two haptic feedback actuators to provide the user with the overall sensation of hitting/ playing a real drum kit. I will also require a custom-made circuit board, housing these essential parts and the battery supply, that will be able to fit this awkward space. With regards to the database server that stores the drum sounds, I will be using a simple Linux Ubuntu server for this purpose. For the application, I will require utilising a GitHub repository to store and collate all of mine and my team's.</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>There are a variety of skills that will be required for the successful completion of this project. In terms of the hardware, it will be necessary to have a solid understanding of circuitry in order to put together device internals, but also how to operate a 3D printer and its designing software (e.g., Fusion360). It will also be a requirement to understand how to operate a Linux device, from both the GUI as well as the terminal for the purpose of managing the database. Finally, it will be essential to have a high understanding of various languages, such as Java, Python and potentially C++ to be able to write the final application.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of the project, users will be able to practice playing the drums in the comfort of their home, and not be concerned about space for a full-sized drum kit, as well as disturbing others in their household and event their neighbourhood from the loud sounds produced from a full-sized kit. This will also allow those who could not afford a full-sized kit to be able to play the drums, as this will be a much more affordable option. It may also even potentially be an option for those people who choose to play the drums in a remote location, such as those who busk. All they will need to do is bring a stool, their sticks, a laptop or phone, and a Bluetooth speaker and they will instantly be able to play.</p>
